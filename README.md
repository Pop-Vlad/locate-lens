LocateLens is a desktop application for accurate and efficient ground-level image geo-localization using state-of-the-art Transformer-based models. Built for researchers, hobbyists, and professionals, the application takes a street-view image as input and predicts its geographic coordinates, displaying the result on an interactive map.

This application supports the use of Vision Transformer (ViT), CoAtNet or ResNet50 to perform regression-based geo-localization. LocateLens directly predicts latitude and longitude coordinates.

 Key Features
- Image Upload: Load street-view images in .jpg or .png format.
- Model Switching: Choose from ResNet50 (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT), or CoAtNet.
- Geo-localization: Run the selected model to estimate and display geographic coordinates.
- Interactive Map: View the predicted location with zoom, pan, and map/satellite toggle features.
- Export Result: Save the current map view as an image.
